  idMask is an app that empowers users to create zero - knowledge proofs,
  allowing them to verify statements about their identity without revealing personal information.

  ## Proof of Age

  Users can generate proof of age to verify that they have lived
  for more than a certain number of years without disclosing their actual age.

  ## Proof of Non - Sanctions

  idMask enables users to prove that their name is not included in the OFAC sanctions list,
  ensuring compliance and trustworthiness.

  ## Proof of Unique Human

  Generate an exclusive identifier that confirms the user 's unique human identity, preventing fraud and ensuring authenticity.

  ## Proof of Nationality

  Prove your nationality status and the country that issued your ID,
  facilitating secure and private verification of citizenship.

  ## Utilization of Proofs

  The generated proofs can be utilized by third parties,
  such as other apps,
  governments,
  and decentralized exchanges,
  ensuring privacy and security in identity verification.`,

Mina Domain Name Service (MNS) allows users to mint domain names using zk-proofs, introducing a new layer of identity and recognition for accounts, tokens, zkApp addresses, and validators on the Mina blockchain.

## Enhancing Identity and Recognition

Introducing a revolutionary solution to address the anonymity of entities on the Mina blockchain. In collaboration with zkCloudWorker, MNS empowers users to mint domain names using zk-proofs, enhancing identity and recognition for accounts, tokens, zkApp addresses, and validators.

## Minting Domain Names with zk-Proofs

MNS enables users to mint domain names represented by Domain Name NFTs stored in IPFS and their PostgreSQL database. This ensures secure and decentralized management of domain names on the Mina blockchain.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend and Backend

The MNS comprises a frontend and backend, alongside a PostgreSQL database for storing minted Domain Name NFTs. The client-side solution focuses on user interaction and data management.

### Blockchain Integration

On the blockchain side, a zkApp is utilized. The zkApp segment of MNS includes a smart contract for minting, updating, and deleting Domain NFTs, with zkCloudWorker producing snark proofs. Two sequencers manage recursive proofs and order/batch transactions, ensuring efficiency and security.

### IPFS Storage

IPFS is employed for storing domain name NFTs, with copies also stored in the MNS database. This dual-storage approach guarantees reliability and accessibility.

## Collaborating with zkCloudWorker

zkCloudWorker plays a crucial role in producing snark proofs, which are essential for the minting process. This collaboration ensures that domain name minting is secure and efficient, leveraging advanced zk-proof technology.

    body: `# TileVille 

TileVille is a city-building arcade game on the MINA blockchain that brings strategic gameplay to new heights. You build your city with ROAD, WindMill, and Tree hexagonal tiles, and if you build a well-planned city, you win rewards.

## Strategic City-Building

Navigate the maze of choices as you construct roads, connecting ports to the heart of your city for valuable points. Harness the power of windmills, strategically placing them on hills for maximum efficiency. Don't forget about parks—group them together in threes to create lush oases of greenery, each cluster a beacon of beauty and bounty.

## Unlocking TileVille

For just 2 MINA tokens, you unlock the gates to TileVille. Your mission? To strategically place trios of hexes, each decision influencing the growth and prosperity of your city. But beware, the path to urban greatness is fraught with challenges and opportunities.

## Achieving Rewards

Score above 70, and you've ascended to Level 1—a feat worthy of celebration. Your reward? A treasure trove awaits, packed with ERC20 and ERC721 asset prizes, including MINA tokens and coveted NFTs. Plus, claim your rightful place on the leaderboard and showcase your city-building prowess to the world.

## The Thrill of TileVille

As a dedicated arcade gamer, I've yearned for the thrill of the arcade experience on the blockchain—a world where nostalgia meets innovation. Picture this: I slide my 2 MINA coins into a digital slot machine, playing the game, and I design a perfect city. And when I win, there it is—the coveted treasure box, brimming with exciting prizes like MINA tokens, rare NFTs, and exclusive vouchers.

## The Essence of Competition

But it's not just about the thrill of winning; it's about the camaraderie of competition. I want to pit my skills against fellow gamers, engaging in high-stakes tournaments where every move counts. Yet, in the realm of Web2-based arcade games, this dream feels distant. These games, governed by centralized authorities, lack the essence of true arcade gaming. The need to link my credit card feels invasive, and the exorbitant fees—like a 30% cut of my hard-earned winnings—only add insult to injury.
